 <h1>Martin's Movie Mayhem</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 films from this week</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>One Day</h3>
 <p>Romcom. Totally predictable but some funny bits. Gorgeous cinematography. 7/10</p>
<h3>Prince Valiant</h3>
<p>Knights of the Round Table. Hilarious for all the wrong reasons. 2/10</p>
<h3>Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>Police. Richard Gere as a bent cop, Andy Garcia as the IA man after him. Tense thriller. 8/10</p>
